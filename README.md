# Why 

After learning about rust, and it's features, i decided to give it a try and learn via some small projects. 

Ny goal with this project is to learn and keep practicing Rust language concepts. 

I'm mostly refering to the rust lang book, and each problem may be similar to the book. 

My goal is to also try and use some algorithmic techniques  so that i can learn and apply common algorithms in rust as much as possible. 

Each subdirectory is a small program in itself.
